# colorchanger
This a a website that contains a button that changes the color of the background everytime you
click on it.It also provides a record of the previous  generated backgroung colours.
 JavaScript was used to manipulate the DOM and update  the color dynamically. I used  CSS transitions or animations to create a smooth transition when the color changes.
